# Towers of Hanoi
-----------------
This is my javascript game project, coded using Javascript, HTML and SCSS during week 3 of my Nology course.

## Usage instructions

Use the dropdown box to select how many discs you wish to start the game with - 3 is the easiest difficulty, 6 is the hardest difficulty. 
Click the buttons underneath each of the 3 stacks, once to pick up a disc, a second time to drop the disc, following the rules at the top of the page.
Win the game by getting all discs from stack A to stack C with the largest on the bottom and smallest on the top.
Click the start again button to reset the game to your chosen difficulty.

## Limitations

When a single disc is on a stack alone, it appears to float slightly off the base of the stack, until a second disc is dropped on top of it.
It is not possible to choose a difficulty higher than 6.
On a large screen, the game looks quite small in the middle.

## It looks like this
